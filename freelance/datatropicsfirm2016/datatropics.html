                        As the leading employer in many developing countries, the agricultural sector
                        is among the most imporant to support, as well as on of the sectors most
                        vulnerable to nature and man-made disasters. In the past, DataTropics has prvided support
                        to operations in the field through a veriety of methods - elevation and
                        flood modeling, pre/ post-intervention videos/ photos/ 3d modeling, NDVI green
                        spectrum analysis, Biomass calculation, cash0crop penetration analyss and regional 
                        surveying.

                        The hard part is coming up with a corporate identity.
                        That is, selecting colors, themes that will appear whroughout the  site.
                        Maybe for this exercise, you can suggest sites that that tou think do this well,
                        and we discuss options?

                        So far I think I like thegreen, blue (tones that I have) on the demographics globe
                        and white theme, but maybe that's too bland.
