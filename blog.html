                    This is my first blog post ever. I hope to use this blog as a space to write about
                    software engineering, how it affects my life, and record discoveries I have made
                    in my scientific expereince. Today I would like to describe my thoughts on tech interviews.

                    Tech interviews tend to vary. Some are very conventional, and stick to the book. These conventional 'big 4' interviews
                    usually look the same way:
                    they call for an initial interview, and that usually leads to a technical interview where
                    the engineer codes on some sort of live chat client, and if the interview goes well,
                    they fly them to the tech campus and give them a <em>white board interview</em>. 
                    Today I had a tech interview that I hope goes really well.
                </p>

                <p class="content">
                    I was really impressed with the professionalism of the engineers. And I have not worked at 
                    a company that has it's own designer in a while. The professionals there were very approachable
                    and gave me confidence that I can grow there as a software engineer, and as a Computer Scientist.
                </p>

                <p class="content">
                    This interview struck me because it seemed like the hiring manager actually picked up on my gerneralist
                    tendencies, and my ability to wear a lot of different hats. Having a company make me feel appreciated for
                    my efforts to be an well rounded person, scientist, and engineer was a very positive experience.
                    Regardless of the outcome, I think I have finished my day a little smarter, which is all I really
                    love to keep me happy.
